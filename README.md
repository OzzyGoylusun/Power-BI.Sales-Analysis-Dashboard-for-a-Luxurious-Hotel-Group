### Project Overview

This Power BI Dashboard project is intended to assist a chained-brand hotel conglomerate with its strategies for customer acquisition and retention as well as a comprehensive analysis of each sales transaction that took place between 2015 and 2017.

The first page of the dashboard includes a number of key metrics per hotel category, such as:

- Average Duration of Stay, Daily Rate & Lead Time
- Polluted Conversion Rate (inc. Non-Refundable Bookings)
- Distribution of Market Segments and Conversion Channels

The second page of the dashboard takes a more granular approach, zeroing on

- Cumulative Sum
- The sales figures from the angle of countries and agents responsible for bookings
- YoY % and MoM % Growth Rates

### Data Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, I performed the following tasks:

1. Inspecting and investigating the dataset
2. Importing of the dataset into the Power BI ecosystem
3. A number of data manipulation tasks

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the commercial data to answer some key questions, including but not limited to:

- What is the overall sales trend over these three years?
- How do the YoY (i.e., Year-over-Year) and MoM % growth rates look?
- Which countries and travel agents performed the best in terms of attracting most number of guests during this period and also each year?


### Data Analysis

As part of my Transaction Analysis series, I first imported the dataset at hand



### Findings

The critical analysis results are summarised as follows:

1. Approximately 97% of all guests turn out to be first timers. While this figure may seem appealing from a customer acquisition point of view


### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, I recommend the following actions:

- Invest further in brand building, marketing and promotions to, for instance, reverse back the declining trend in order count starting from November 2017 onwards, as shown below:
- Further promote relationships with the company's all travel agents and tour operators.
- 

  
### Limitations

As the dataset was based upon a static file, it is inherently deprived of any prospective data which might impact subsequent strategical and/or tactical decisions that the hotel conglomerate may undertake.
