### Data Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, I performed the following tasks:

1. Database creation from scratch

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the commercial data to answer some key questions, including but not limited to:

- What is the overall sales trend over these three years?


### Data Analysis

As part of my Transaction Analysis series, I first imported the dataset at hand



### Findings

The critical analysis results are summarised as follows:

1. Approximately 97% of all guests turn out to be first timers. While this figure may seem appealing from a customer acquisition point of view


### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, I recommend the following actions:

- Invest further in brand building, marketing and promotions to, for instance, reverse back the declining trend in order count starting from November 2017 onwards, as shown below:
- Further promote relationships with the company's all travel agents and tour operators.
- 

  
### Limitations

As the dataset was based upon a static file, it is inherently deprived of any prospective data which might impact subsequent strategical and/or tactical decisions that the hotel conglomerate may undertake.
